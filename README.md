# Hey, I'm Vardhin üåü

*Code is art. Every line breathes life into imagination.*

## Who Am I? 

I'm someone who sees code as sculpture and pixels as poetry. I dive headfirst into the unknown, treating mountains like haybales and turning wild ideas into living, breathing experiences.

**Currently obsessing over:** Agentic AI and pushing LLM boundaries - converting quadratic complexities to sub-quadratic, building AI pipelines that actually make sense, and exploring ways to make current architectures sing.

**My philosophy:** The journey is everything. I don't just write code; I craft experiences that have soul.

## What I've Built That Actually Matters

### üîê **Recon** - Truly Decentralized Messaging
A messaging app where your data belongs to **you** and only you. Built with:
- **GunDB** for decentralized data
- **WebTorrent** for peer-to-peer magic  
- **Svelte** frontend (because React is overrated)
- **Patent pending** for the architecture

It's still evolving, but it's my pride and joy - true privacy without compromises.

### üåå **My Portfolio** - [vardhin.tech](https://vardhin.tech)
Custom GLSL shaders simulating realistic clouds, sky, sun, moon, and twinkling stars. Light/dark mode? Just drag the sun across the sky like controlling time itself. Because why settle for a toggle when you can have magic?

## My Arsenal (Things I Actually Use)

**Frontend:** Svelte (my beloved), custom shaders, anything that lets me paint pixels  
**Backend:** Node.js, Python FastAPI (for AI stuff)  
**Web3:** GunDB, Ethereum via Hardhat/Ganache  
**Mobile:** React Native Expo (simple), Kotlin (when I need power)  
**Languages I Speak:** Telugu (mother tongue ‚ù§Ô∏è), English, Hindi, Tamil (learning), Japanese (dabbling)  
**OS:** Arch Linux + Hyprland (because customization is life)

**What I avoid:** Cloud services are my arch nemesis. If it can't run locally or peer-to-peer, I'm probably not interested.

## Beyond Code

**Literature:** I write poems and stories, then build RPG games to bring them to life  
**Music:** Creating melodies when words aren't enough  
**Psychology:** Understanding what makes humans tick  
**Philosophy:** Optimistically charging ahead, using setbacks as a sculptor's chisel

**Current linguistic adventure:** Learning Tamil, because every language is a new way to think.

## My Approach

I don't "struggle" with problems - I see challenges as haybales, not mountains. I:
1. **Dive in** without knowing everything
2. **Fiddle** until it clicks  
3. **Version control** my journey
4. **Iterate** until my vision breathes

**Learning style:** Hands-on chaos. Break things, fix them, learn by doing.

*"Whatever I do, I put my soul into it. Code isn't just logic - it's poetry in motion, dreams taking digital form."*
